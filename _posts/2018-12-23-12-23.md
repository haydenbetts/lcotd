This command comes from a video tutorial explaning how to solve one of the intentionally vulnerable machines on [Hack the Box](https://hackthebox.eu). Here is is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMGsnPSm8iw&t=18m50s) to the appropriate timestamp in the video.

Here is a sample of the type of evently spaced 5-column output that the command produces
```
.                   .                     root  root  755
.gitignore          ./.gitignore          root  root  644
firstprog.c         ./firstprog.c         root  root  644
a.out               ./a.out               root  root  755
```

Let's take it apart.

`find /home`: The most basic form of the find command is `find fooDir -name barFile -print`

In this case, however, we run `find` with _dir_ set to `home`. We omit the `-name` flag. This means that we want to `find` every file in the home directory. 

`-printf "%f\t%p\t%u\t%g\t%m\n"`: `printf` is short for "formatted print." It provides more fine-grained control over its output that than standard `-print` flag. For an extensive discussion of the differences between `print` and `printf`, see [[^1]].

So what is `"%f\t%p\t%u\t%g\t%m\n"`? All together, it is known as a `printf format string`[[^2]] Every character prefixed with a `%` in this expression is known as a *format-control character*. Each character prefixed with a `\` is known as an *escape sequence*. So this means we have the following format control letters:
`%f`, `%p`, `%u`, `%g`, `%m`, and the following escape sequences `\t` and `\n`.

Let's consult the [manpage](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html) for `find`, and break these down.

`%f`: File's name with any leading directories removed (only the last element).

`%p`: File's name.

`%u`: File's user name, or numeric user ID if the user has no name. 

`%g`: File's group name, or numeric group ID if the group has no name.

`%m`: File's permission bits (in octal)...

`\t`: Horizontal tab.

`\n`: Newline.

SO, on a high level, what are doing here is examining basic name and permissions info every file in a directory, and printing to STDOUT in a (tab separated way).

> NOTE: It is interesting and confusing that the printf format control letters mean something different when used by `file` than when they are used in standard `C`. For example, in `C`'s `printf` function the `%f` indicates a `type`. Specifically, it indicates that a number will be rendered as a `double`, whereas in this case `%f` stands for a file's name.

`2>/dev/null`: Here, we are redirecting the `STDERR` output stream to `/dev/null`. "`/dev/null` is a null device that takes any input you want and throws it away. It can be used to suppress any output."[[^3]][[^4]]

`|column -t`: Here, we are piping the `STDOUT` output stream to the `column` utility. `column` simply `columnates lists`. 

The `-t` flag `Determines the number of columns the input contains and creates a table.  Columns are delimited with whitespace, by default...` So, `column` looks at `STDOUT`, and creates evenly spaced columns at each `\t` (whitespace) that we set above.

Here is some ouput without piping to `column -t`
```
pre-push.sample	./.git/hooks/pre-push.sample	root	root	755
applypatch-msg.sample	./.git/hooks/applypatch-msg.sample	root	root	755
HEAD	./.git/HEAD	root	root	644
```

and after piping to it.
```
pre-push.sample         ./.git/hooks/pre-push.sample         root  root  755
applypatch-msg.sample   ./.git/hooks/applypatch-msg.sample   root  root  755
HEAD                    ./.git/HEAD                          root  root  644
```
Ah... so evenly spaced
