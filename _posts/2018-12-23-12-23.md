This command comes from a video tutorial explaning how to solve one of the introductory intentionally vulnerable machines on [Hack the Box](https://hackthebox.eu). Here is is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMGsnPSm8iw&t=18m50s) to the appropriate timestamp in the video.

Here is a sample of the type of 5-column output that the command produces
```
.                   .                     root  root  755
.gitignore          ./.gitignore          root  root  644
firstprog.c         ./firstprog.c         root  root  644
a.out               ./a.out               root  root  755
```
