This command comes from Section 9.4 of (Ward, How Linux Works).

Here is some sample output
```
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
0.0.0.0         10.0.2.2        0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
10.0.2.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
```

Let's take it apart.

`netstat`: Netstat is a deep utility that can display all kinds of invormation related to network status. I hope to delve more deeply into it in the coming days.

`-r`: display the kernel routing table
`-n`: show only numeric addresses rather than performing any kind of name resolution.

Let's look at some output without the `-n` flag to see what that name resolution looks like.
```
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
default         _gateway        0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
10.0.2.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
```

OK, so the interface of this command is pretty simple, but its understanding its ouput requires a bit of context.
I will do my best to restate some of my takeaways from on this subject from How Linux Works.

Columns 1-3: `Destination`, `Gateway`, `Genmask`

These three columns work in conjunction, and cannot be separated meaningfully.
The `Genmask` is known as a subnet mask. It is hard to explain how this works, and Ward does so wondefully

> “You define a subnet with two pieces: a network prefix and a subnet mask (such as the one in the output of ifconfig in the previous section). Let’s say you want to create a subnet containing the IP addresses between 10.23.2.1 and 10.23.2.254. The network prefix is the part that is common to all addresses in the subnet; in this example, it’s 10.23.2.0, and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. 
>Let’s see why those are the right numbers.
It’s not immediately clear how the prefix and mask work together to give you all possible IP addresses on a subnet. Looking at the numbers in binary form helps clear it up. The mask marks the bit locations in an IP address that are common to the subnet. For example, here are the binary forms of 10.23.2.0 and 255.255.255.0:
```
10.23.2.0:        00001010 00010111 00000010 00000000
255.255.255.0:    11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000”
```
Excerpt From: Brian Ward. “How Linux Works: What Every Superuser Should Know.” iBooks. 

Perhaps the most common subnet is a network of devices in a home, all of which are cordoned off from the internet at large by a router/gateway.

Now that we have an understanding of the `Genmask` column, let's example some more of the output.
```
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
0.0.0.0         10.0.2.2        0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
10.0.2.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
```

`Destination` represents the `IPv4` address of a device to which your computer makes a request (this could be any type of request. Not necessarily just an HTTP request. For example, the `ping` utility makes `ICMP` Internet Control Message Protocol requests). 

`0.0.0.0` is a meta-address that matches all addresses in the IPv4 address space. But it has different meanings in different contexts. In column 1: `Destination`, I am confident that it is acting as the `default route.` The entry in the `Gateway` column of the `default route's` row is known as the `default gateway`. As Ward says, “When no other rules match, the default route always does, and the default gateway is where you send messages when there is no other choice.”

So, in the case of this Kernel Routing Table, if we make an `HTTP` request to `google.com`, our request will `Destination` will be matched by `0.0.0.0`, (and not by any IPs in the subnet), so it be forwarded to the `Gateway` indicated in the `Gateway` column. The `G` flag indicates that "communication for this network must be sent through the gateway in the Gateway column."

Now let's imagine making a request to `10.0.2.3`. Our request will be matched by the `Genmask` + `Destination` pattern as described above. Since there is no `G` in the `Flags` column, we know that we must be directly connected to this device in some way. This means that the `kernel` will allow direct device to device communication in this case!
